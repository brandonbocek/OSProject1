1. The project is Excerice 3.8 from the book. It can be found at this repository on github

https://github.com/brandonbocek/OSProject1.git

2. type "make all" into the command line to compile all 8 of the steps
many of the first few steps are the same though because there weren't
any changes needed to be made

3. call a step by typing "./run# #"
For example to run part 1 for 10 processes 
you would type "./run1 10"

Here is the format running each executable

	./run1 #ofProcesses
	./run2 #ofProcesses
	./run3 #ofProcesses
	./run4 #ofProcesses
	./run5 #ofProcesses #howManyLoops #howManySleepMs
	./run6 #ofProcesses
	./run7 #ofProcesses
	./run8 #ofProcesses #ofCharsToReadIn

4. To call the getopts part and to see the
error messages type -(char) for example "./run 20 -a"

5. To remove all of the executables from the make all
type "make clean"
