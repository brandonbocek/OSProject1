1. The process ID is always 1 less than the child ID.
 The parent ID for each process ID is equal to 1 for
 every 2 to 4 processes for lower numbers.

3. There doesn't seem to be a single number that is
 the largest number of processes that the program
 can create. If I run 50000 processes sometimes it
 will run them all and other times it will quit
 after only a few thousand processes. The larger the
 number I enter in the command line, the more likely
 the processes won't finish and the program stops sooner.

4. The maximum number of processes generated is 28.

5. The program doesn't output any process ID's.

6. The process ID's are outputted in reverse order.

7. The first 2-4 processes are displayed before the bash 
prompts me again. The rest are displayed after the next prompt.
Most of the time the parent ID is 1, but sometimes it is 1 less
than the process ID. The child ID is always 1 more than the
process ID.

8. The program prompts me to enter my first character by the 
number that I entered as the command line argument. Then I
have to control-shift to exit.
